```python
[Literate programs][literate] employ multiple language forms to communicate computational thought.
They target human readable documents and computational source code.
Donald Knuth's original literate programming implementation WEB combines $\LaTeX$ for document formatting and Pascal computation.
This approach to composition allows a program to express a narrative in human & computer logic.

```python
The literate program has two components: the document langauge and programming language.  
Programming languages have another dichotomy of an statically typed application and a dynamically typed scripting language.

```python
    import xonsh
A modern implementation of literate programming could use Markdown as a document language.  
Markdown is a flexible markup language that permits any programming language as a subset.
A holistic literate programming language should have access to scripting and application languages.
In this tool, we choose `xonsh` which allows scripting in python and application programming in bash.

```python
Now using markdown we can run bash code inline `git status` and python `print(F"{__name__} woo")`.
And of course indented code is run as expected.

    x = $(ls)
    print('----')
    print(len(x))
```

We can `doctest` stuff too!

    >>> echo hello
    hello
    <BLANKLINE>
    >>> 11
